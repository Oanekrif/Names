This C program allows the user to enter up to 10 names, storing them in a 2D array. </br> 
The program prompts the user for each name and stops accepting input when the user enters "exit", "-1", or "0". </br> 
It then displays the entered names in a comma-separated format, ending with a period. </br> 
The program uses a for loop to collect the names and a strcmp function to check for the exit conditions, ensuring it stops when one of these values is entered. </br> 
The final list of names is displayed in a neat, formatted output.
